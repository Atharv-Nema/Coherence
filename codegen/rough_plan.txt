Converting to llvm specific names
1. Functions:
Function within an actor:
<func_name>.<actor_name>.func
Outside an actor/toplevel:
<func_name>.func

2. Behaviours:
<be_name>.<actor_name>.be 

3. Constructors
<constructor_name>.<actor_name>.constr

Generated structs:
1. Actor struct:
<actor_name>.struct
2. Behaviour struct:
<be_name>.<actor_name>.be.struct

Generated types:
1. A struct T is converted to T.struct


Additional registers passed in:

Passed in parameters for functions and constructors:
a) %this.id: Id of the current actor instance
b) %this.mem: Pointer to the body of the current actor
c) %lock_instance.id: Id of the actor on which the lock must be called

When calling:
1. Functions
%this.mem passed to function must be %this.mem in current scope
%this.id passed to function must be %this.id in current scope
%lock_instance.id passed to function must be %lock_instance.id 
in current scope (this must also be equal to %this.id in current scope)
2. Constructors
%this.mem passed in must be the one of the newly created object
%this.id passed in must be %this.id of the newly created object
%lock_instance.id passed in must be %lock_instance.id in current scope

Behaviours:
The last two fields of the struct are
%this.id and %this.mem

Compiling:
1. Functions inside actors, constructors and behaviours will unpack %this.mem
   into its members 
2. Behaviours will set %lock_instance.id to %this.id
