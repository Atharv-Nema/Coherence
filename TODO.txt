1. Functions actor scoping needs to be handled somehow? I think that is fine though and can be handled from the env. Need to 
   make changes.
2. So now to get the type of a variable, 2 checks are done. If you are in the actor, then you get it from there.
3. Need to think carefully about my handling of duplicate function names and stuff like that
